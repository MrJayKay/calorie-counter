 Free Code Camp Calorie Counter Project


In this Free Code Camp Project I built a calorie counter application that allows users to in input data and receive data output.

 I learnt how to accept input from a user, how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results. I also learnt basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.


 - add input for steps counted with a basic calculation for steps = calroies burnt.
 - change user interface to be more visually related to fitness.
 - add user name in put and allow the user to store data on a continued basis.
 - add an additial veiw section beside the application to show inspirational quotes.
